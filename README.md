## Modelling

### General

#### Neural Networks
- DeepLearning: a neural network with more than one layer.
- Types of neural network:
    - Feedforward -> common classification or regression
    - Convolutional (CNN) -> image classification
    - Recurrent (RNN) -> sequences (time, words, etc.)
- Activation functions
    - Linear activation
    - Binary step function
    - Non-linear functions (backpropagation, multiple layers)
        - Sigmoid / Logistic / TanH

        - Other ReLU (swish, maxout)
    - Softmax: usually last layer of a classification NN.
    - How to choose one?
        - Multi classification -> softmax on output layer
        - RNN -> TanH
        - Everything else -> ReLU > Leaky ReLU, PReLU, Maxout > Swish (deep networks)
- Convolutional Neural Networks

        - Fine-tune
            - Format input data as it was when the model was trained originally
            - Start training the model with low learning rate.
        - Add new trainable layers on top of the existing model
        - Retrain from scratch using the architecture
            - beware of data and money!
#### Tuning Neural Networks (Hyperparameters)
- Learning Rate
    - Training is based on gradient descent on a cost function
    - Learning Rate sets up the rythm.
        - High LR -> overshoot correct solution
        - Low LR -> too slow
- Batch size
    - How many training samples are used within each batch of each epoch
    - Small batch sizes can skip local minimum
    - Big batch sizes can get stuck into local minimum
- Regularization
    - Prevent overfitting
    - Techniques
        - Simpler model
        - Dropout
        - Early stopping
        - L1: sum of weights -> feature selection -> Sparse output
        - L2: sum of weights^2 -> all features considered, just weighted -> Dense output
#### Evaluation and debugging
- Vanishing Gradient Problem
    - When gradient approaches zero (near the local minimum) computational problems arise with very low numbers.
    - Fixes:
        - Multi-level hierarchy: train levels separately
        - Specific architectures: LSTM, ResNet
        - Better activation function: ReLU is a good choice (because of its 45Âº straight line)
    - Gradient checking is a debugging/diagnostic tool
- Confusion Matrix
    - Accuracy might not tell the whole story, usually with anomalies.
    - True Positives: Actual YES, Predicted YES (â)
    - False Positives: Actual NO, Predicted YES (x)
    - False Negatives: Actual YES, Predicted NO (x)
    - True Negative: Actual NO, Predicted NO (â)
- Precision, Recall, F1, AUC
    - Recall = Sensitivity = Completeness = TP / (TP + FN)
        - Used mainly in fraud detection
    - Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
        - Used in drug testing, medical screening
    - Specificity = TN / (TN + FP)
    - F1 score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
        - Used when we care about both Precision and Recall
    - RMSE: Root Mean Squared Errors
    - ROC Curve: Receiver Operating Characterisctic Curve
        - The more "bent" towards the upper-left corner, the better
    - AUC: Area under the ROC Curve
        - AUC of 0.5 is a useless model
        - AUC of 1.0 is a perfect model
    - P-R Curve: Precision/Recall curve
        - The higher the area under the curve, the better.
        - Good for information retrieval and large number of documents
#### Ensemble Methods
- Take multiple models and let them vote for the final result
- Bagging
    - Generate N new training sets by random sampling with replacement
    - Avoids overfitting
    - Easier to parallelize
- Boosting
    - Sequentially train multiple models
    - Some data points will repeat
    - Output from previous models is considered for next models
    - XGBoost
