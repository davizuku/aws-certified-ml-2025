    - How to choose one?
        - Multi classification -> softmax on output layer
        - RNN -> TanH
        - Everything else -> ReLU > Leaky ReLU, PReLU, Maxout > Swish (deep networks)

            - Start training the model with low learning rate.
        - Add new trainable layers on top of the existing model
        - Retrain from scratch using the architecture
            - beware of data and money!
#### Tuning Neural Networks (Hyperparameters)
- Learning Rate
    - Training is based on gradient descent on a cost function
    - Learning Rate sets up the rythm.
        - High LR -> overshoot correct solution
        - Low LR -> too slow
- Batch size
    - How many training samples are used within each batch of each epoch
    - Small batch sizes can skip local minimum
    - Big batch sizes can get stuck into local minimum
- Regularization
    - Prevent overfitting
    - Techniques
        - Simpler model
        - Dropout
        - Early stopping
        - L1: sum of weights -> feature selection -> Sparse output
        - L2: sum of weights^2 -> all features considered, just weighted -> Dense output
#### Evaluation and debugging
- Vanishing Gradient Problem
    - When gradient approaches zero (near the local minimum) computational problems arise with very low numbers.
    - Fixes:
        - Multi-level hierarchy: train levels separately
        - Specific architectures: LSTM, ResNet
        - Better activation function: ReLU is a good choice (because of its 45Âº straight line)
    - Gradient checking is a debugging/diagnostic tool
- Confusion Matrix
    - Accuracy might not tell the whole story, usually with anomalies.
    - True Positives: Actual YES, Predicted YES (â)
    - False Positives: Actual NO, Predicted YES (x)
    - False Negatives: Actual YES, Predicted NO (x)
    - True Negative: Actual NO, Predicted NO (â)
- Precision, Recall, F1, AUC
    - Recall = Sensitivity = Completeness = TP / (TP + FN)
        - Used mainly in fraud detection
    - Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
        - Used in drug testing, medical screening
    - Specificity = TN / (TN + FP)
    - F1 score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
        - Used when we care about both Precision and Recall
    - RMSE: Root Mean Squared Errors
    - ROC Curve: Receiver Operating Characterisctic Curve
        - The more "bent" towards the upper-left corner, the better
    - AUC: Area under the ROC Curve
        - AUC of 0.5 is a useless model
        - AUC of 1.0 is a perfect model
    - P-R Curve: Precision/Recall curve
        - The higher the area under the curve, the better.
        - Good for information retrieval and large number of documents
#### Ensemble Methods
- Take multiple models and let them vote for the final result
- Bagging
    - Generate N new training sets by random sampling with replacement
    - Avoids overfitting
    - Easier to parallelize
- Boosting
    - Sequentially train multiple models
    - Some data points will repeat
    - Output from previous models is considered for next models
    - XGBoost

- Automatic Model Tuning
    - Manual tuning of all the combinations of hyperparameters explodes
    - HyperParameter Tuning Job, does not try all combinations, but smartly picks which ones make more sense.
    - Best practices:
        - Don't try too many hyperparams at once
        - Limit ranges to its smallest possible
        - Use log scales

## Generative AI

### Transformer Achitecture
- "Attention is all you need" (2017)
    - Focused on NLP
    - Attention refers to the change of paradigm in Encoder-Decoder architectures related to sequence-to-sequence models (RNNs)
    - In typical Seq2Seq models, there is a _Last Hidden State_ at the end of the _encoder_, which is used to feed the _encoder_.
    - The change implies not using one single _Hidden State_, but to use one state for each member of the sequence.
    - In addition, instead of using RNNs, which still process all elements in sequential order, use Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs) encoding the _positional order_ and the _attention weights_. This way, each FFNN is independent, so the whole sequence can be parallelized and much more data can be used to train the model -> Large Language Models.
    - In language translation this allows to consider **word order** and **word relationships**, using _attention weights_.
- Self-attention
    - Learn relationships beween words and encode it into an embedding reflecting its true meaning. In this example both sentences use the _novel_ word, but with different meanings:
        - I read a good _novel_ -> _book_
        - Attention is a _novel_ idea -> _original_
    - Internal architecture:
        - Three matrices of weights learned through back-propagation: Query (`Wq`):, Key (`Wk`):, Value (`Wv`):
        - Token vectors = [
            `token_embedding * Wq, (Vq)`,
            `token_embedding * Wk, (Vk)`,
            `token_embedding * Wv, (Vv)`,
        ]
        - For each token, `Vscore = softmax([Vq Â· Vk0, Vq Â· Vk1, ..., Vq Â· Vn ])`
        - Masked Self-Attention to prevent looking for future words in a sentence, as humans do while reading.
        - For each token, `Vproduct = Vscore * Vv`
        - Then, for each token, `Vz = sum(Vproduct_i for 0 <= i < n)`
        - `Vz` of a token represents its _true meaning_
        - `Vz` now replaces the token embeddings into the FFNN capturing the context for each word in the sentence.
        - This whole process is optimized using _Multi-headed self-attention_ converting vectors into n-headed row matrices for parallel computing.

    - Question answering
    - Text classification
    - Named entity recognition
    - Summarization
    - Translation
    - Code generation
    - Text generation
### From Transformers to GPT
- Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT-2)
- Decoder-only block (as in encoder-decoder architecture)
- Encoders not needed due to parallelism
- (BERT uses only encoders)
- Only predicting the next word
- Architecture of the GPT-2 model:
    - Input string: `string`
    - Tokenization -> Tokens: `string[]`
    - Tokens -> embedding: `embedding[]`
    - Positional encoding: interleaved sinusoidal function
    - Stacked list of Decoder Blocks, each consisting of (see previous sections):
        - Masked Self-attention
        - Feed-Forward Neural Network
    - Output Token Embedding, multiply by a Token Embedding matrix getting a list of probabilities.
    - Token Probabilities
        - Temperature is the amount of randomness
        - Temperature = 0 -> use the most probable.
    - Token to string: `string`
### Transfer Learning (Fine Tuning)
- Add additional data to an existing LLM.
- Options:
    - Freeze specific layers, re-train the others
    - Add a layer on top of the pre-trained model

    - Amazon Titan: text summarization, generation, Q&A, embeddings, ...
- Use it with Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart
    - Huggingface models: Falcon, Flan, GPT-J
- Fine-tune foundation models
    - Using a `template.json` and a set of `jsonl` files in S3:
        - Default template:
        ```json
            {
                "prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\n{instruction}\n\n### Input:\n{context}",
                "completion": "{response}",
            }
        ```
    - Then, each line in the `jsonl` files would need to contain: ```jsonl
            {"instruction": ..., "context": ..., "response": ...},
            {"instruction": ..., "context": ..., "response": ...},
        ...
        ```
