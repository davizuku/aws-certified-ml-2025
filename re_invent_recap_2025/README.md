# re:Invent (Jan 2025)

- Amazon Nova -> new foundation models
    - Understanding: Micro, Lite, Pro, Premier
        - Customizable, through model destillation & fine-tunning
    - Creative: Canvas, Reel
- Amazon Guardrails
    - Controlling allucination -> automated reasoning
        - Automated Reasoning Policies are created from documents
        - Debugging rules
        - Multimodal toxicity detection (images only for now)
- Amazon Bedrock
    - Prompt routing and caching can save up to 30% on models by redirecting prompts to the optimal model
    - Prompt optimization: rewrite prompts with the help of LLMs
    - Multi-agent collaboration
        - Why multi-agent needed?
            - Each agent has a different knowledge base
            - It is good to fragment specialties
            - It is close to how you would do it with people
- Amazon SageMaker (new generation)
    - SageMaker -> SageMaker AI
    - SageMaker unified studio
        - Data Processing
        - SQL Analytics
        - Model Development
        - Gen AI App development
        - Streaming (coming soon)
        - Search (coming soon)
        - Business intelligence
    - Team
        - Create a project
        - Git integration for a project
        - Data Engineer
            - Uploaded data into a project will be available to all people in the team
            - Data catalog
            - Amazon Q integrated into the ETL flow
        - Spark expert
            - Same URL
            - Use Athena or Redshift for querying the data
            - Jupyter Labs includes Q for helps
            - Publish data to the catalog to make it available for the rest of the team
        - Gen AI app developer
            - Foundation models (from Bedrock)
            - Compare models and choose the best one
    - SageMaker Lakehouse
        - Unified data management, access and flexibility of the storage
            - Single copy of data
        - Open to choose ML engine, compatible with Apache Iceberg API
        - Security:
            - Set permissions into a single place
        - Ingestion in near-real-time with zero-etl
        - Pricing: not additional cost, pay for the services you use under the hood.
        - Query federation: query without transforming data
    - SageMaker Hyperpod
        - Features
            - Resilient environment
                - Tracks the training and saves checkpoints
                - In case of a failure it will continue from the checkpoint
            - Streamline distributed training
            - Customizable UX and persistent cluster
        - Use cases
            - Train large foundation models
            - Training and fine-tuning foundation models
        - Difference with regular training
            - Regular training does not have checkpoints -> restars the whole training
